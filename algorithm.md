# Algorithm

## Algorithm - specific steps to solve a problem

An algorithm is a specific sequence of discrete steps to solve a problem or define a process.

Pseudo-code and Flow-charts are alternate ways to specify an algorithm to represent a process or to solve a problem.

Once the algorithm has been specified using these approaches, then a specific programming language can be used to implement the code so a computer can execute the commands.
