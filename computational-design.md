#Computational Design

Computational Design considers design from an logic algorithmic and computational perspective.

How can a design be specified using a logic, rules, and formal language so that it can be rendered by a computer? 

In addition to simply rendering a design, computers can also be used to provide interaction with designs, so the computational specification of a design can also include methods for interaction and modification of designs.  

Within the area of Computational design, there are a several sub-categories:

Generative Art and Design

Procedural Design

Parametric Design

Algorithmic Design
