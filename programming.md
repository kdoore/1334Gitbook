Programming
============

1. A sequence of instructions for a computer system to execute

2. Programming Languages like ***Javascript*** define ‘syntax’ of how to write instructions
 
3. Programming Libraries like ***Processing.js*** provide pre-written functions for common tasks

4. A Script or Program is a series of instructions translated into a strict, formal language with no ambiguity

###Algorithm - specific steps to solve a problem
  Pseudo-code and Flow-charts are code-agnostic ways to specify an algorithm to represent a process or to solve a problem
  
###Program Instructions
 - **Statements** - Like a sentence (a command) 
 - **Expressions** - evaluates to a value
 - **Functions** - a way to structure code to make it modular and to support code reuse
 - 

### Program Design and Modeling
 - A representation of structure or process.
 - Identify components in a system.
 - Create a representation of that system using programming.(simulation)
 - Metaphors are useful in creating representations. (Desktop metaphor)
 - Mental Model: our internal representation of a system
