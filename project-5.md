#Project 5 - Scene Management

For project 5, you will be integrating scenes into your previous project.  We'll use a Finite State Machine to model the logic to manage changing scenes.  

###Nested Finite State Machines 
For our final project, we'll have 2 different Finite State Machines, since we had already implemented a FSM to control our character's animation.  So, the diagram below shows that there are nested FSM's in our project.  The FSM's are independent, each relies on it's own state variable to keep track of the current state.  We need to provide code to implement the conceptual model captured in each FSM's structure.
