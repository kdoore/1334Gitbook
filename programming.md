## Programming with Javascript and Processing

1. **What is a Programming?**  Programming is the process of writing a sequence of instructions for a computer system to execute, in order to solve a problem or complete a task.

2. **What is Javascript?** Programming Languages like _**Javascript**_ define ‘syntax’ of how to write instructions that are simple enough to be executed by a computer.

3. **What is a Programming Library? ** Programming libraries like _**Processing.js**_ provide pre-written functions for common tasks.  

4. A Script or Program is a series of instructions translated into a strict, formal language - simple enough for a computer to interpret or execute.

5. Computers store data, and can execute statements in a program.   

6. Data is stored in a computer's memory in the form of digital bits with a value of: 1 or 0 

   1. a byte is a chunk-size of memory that consists of 8 digital bits of memory.   

   2. a byte can hold 256 possible values \(0 - 255\)


### Program Instructions

* **Statements** - Like a sentence \(a command\)
* **Expressions** - evaluate to a single value
* **Functions** - a way to structure code to make it modular and to support code reuse,

Functions can be used as program statements or expressions if they return a value.

### Program Design and Modeling

* A representation of structure or process.
* Identify components in a system.
* Create a representation of that system using programming.\(simulation\)
* Metaphors are useful in creating representations. \(Desktop metaphor\)
* Mental Model: our internal representation of a system
