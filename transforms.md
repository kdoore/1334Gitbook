# Geometric Transform Functions

Transformations are functions that can be used to change the physical configuration of the drawing canvas. This can provide powerful design techniques. The following transformations can be applied to the canvas: [See Khan Academy Tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/programming-transformations/a/translation). Based on this [Processing Tutorial](https://www.processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/)

* **translate\( x, y \)** //move the origin to position\(x,y\),then all shapes are now drawn relative to the new position of the origin. It is often easier to move the canvas origin, when trying to draw objects that have some geometric relation with each other, such as a joint or point of rotation.
* **rotate\( angle \)** // rotate the canvas through angle \( degrees / radians \)in the clockwise direction for positive values of angle. All subsequent shapes are drawn on the rotated canvas, until resetMatrix\(\) or popMatrix\(\) have been called.
* **scale\( x, y \)** // changes the size of the canvas: larger or smaller - also impacts strokeWeight

### translate\( xDist, yDist\)

The processing translate function moves the canvas origin xDist in the x direction, yDist in the y direction.  

### Using translate with custom functions

Translation can be very useful when writing a function that draws some shapes at a location specified as input parameters.  

{% hint style="info" %}
**Where do you think the rectangle will be drawn relative to the default origin?**

at the point:  \( 110, 220 \)
{% endhint %}

```javascript
//messy approach 
var drawShape1 = function( xPos, yPos ){  
    fill(255, 0,0);
    rect( 10 + xPos, 20 + yPos, 50, 80) ; //adjust shape values, messy
};

//use transform functions - elegant
var drawShape2 = function( xPos, yPos ){
 translate( xPos, yPos); //move origin to xPos, yPos
 fill( 255, 0,0);
 rect( 10, 20, 50, 80 ); //draw shape relative to origin
 resetMatrix( );  //move origin back to default location
  };
  
   //call the function
  drawShape1( 100, 200); 
  drawShape2( 100, 200); 
```

## Rotate\( someDegrees\)

The processing rotate\( \) function rotates the canvas around the origin as a pivot point.  This can be a bit confusing.  It is almost always necessary to use the translate\( xDist, yDist \) function when using rotate\( \) because most of time you do not want to rotate from the upper left corner of the canvas.  So, first you must use translate\( \) so that you can move the origin to the desired pivot position, then call rotate\( \), then draw shapes, finally, call resetMatrix\( \) to put the origin back to the default position.  

```javascript
//use transform, rotate functions - elegant
var drawShape3 =  function( xPos, yPos, angle ){
 translate( xPos, yPos); //move origin to xPos, yPos
 rotate( angle );  // rotation is always around the origin
 fill( 255, 0,0);
 rect( 10, 20, 50, 80 ); //draw shape relative to origin
 resetMatrix( );  //move origin back to default location
  };
  
  drawShape3( 100, 200, 75 );   //angle is 75% 
```

## Transformation Matrix

The transformation **`matrix`** is a global data-table that stores the configuration information of the canvas. 

The **default** values for the matrix can always be reset by calling the function: **`resetMatrix()`**. This resets the canvas so the origin is at the upper left corner, and resets rotation to 0 degrees and scaling to 1.0.

## resetMatrix\(\)

The resetMatrix\( \) function sets the origin back to the original, upper-left corner of the canvas, and it removes all other pushMatrix, popMatrix \(snapshot\) data from the transformation-history stack.

```java
var draw = function(){

    translate( 100, 100);
    rotate( 30 );
    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rotated rect drawn at 100,100
    resetMatrix();
    //rectangle below is not impacted by prior transforms
    //since resetMatrix reset to transforms to default 
    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rect drawn at canvas origin: 0,0

}
```

## pushMatrix\(\), popMatrix\(\)

The `pushMatrix()` function stores the current state of the transformation Matrix in a **stack** structure, it is like a snapshot is taken of the current transform values and that is saved for later use. Then the `popMatrix()` function can be used to retrieve the most recent state of the transformation matrix that was stored on the **stack** pushMatrix and popMatrix must be used in pairs, pushMatrix is used to save the state of the transforms that have already been applied prior to pushMatrix\( \) being called. Once popMatrix\(\) is called, all changes to transforms that happened after the most recent pushMatrix\( \) are undone, but all prior transforms still impact shapes drawn after pushMatrix\( \). To summarize, any transforms set within a pair of pushMatrix\( \) and popMatrix\( \) functions do not impact any code outside of that pair of functions. However, any transforms applied prior to pushMatrix\( \) remain. This allows for creating relationships between shapes such as a character's center point, and rotation that would occur at a character's shoulder, elbow, and wrist.

```java
var draw = function(){

    translate( 100, 0); //shift origin horizontal 
    pushMatrix();
      translate( 0, 100); //shift origin vertically
      rotate( 30 ); 
      rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rotated rect drawn at 100,100
    popMatrix(); //undoes transforms since last pushMatrix( )
    //rectangle below is impacted by original translate(100,0), but none of the changes inside pushMatrix(), popMatrix( ) pair.

    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rect drawn at: 100,0
}
```

## rectMode\( CENTER\)

The processing function: rectMode\( CENTER \); changes the way that rectangles are drawn. All rectangles drawn after this line of code will have the x,y input parameters used as the rectangle's center point. This makes it easier to rotate rectangles around their center point. This can be undone using rectMode\(CORNER\);
