# Geometric Transform Functions

Transformations are functions that can be used to change the physical configuration of the drawing canvas. This can provide powerful design techniques. The following transformations can be applied to the canvas: [See Khan Academy Tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/programming-transformations/a/translation). Based on this [Processing Tutorial](https://www.processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/)

* **translate\( x-offset, y-offset \)** //moves the origin:  in x-dimension by x-offset amount, in y-dimension by y-offset. All shapes are now drawn relative to the new position of the origin. It is often easier to move the canvas origin, when trying to draw objects that have some geometric relation with each other, such as a joint or center of rotation.
* **rotate\( angle \)** // rotate the canvas through angle \( degrees / radians \)in the clockwise direction for positive values of angle. All subsequent shapes are drawn on the rotated canvas, until resetMatrix\(\) or popMatrix\(\) have been called.
* **scale\( w, h\)** // changes the size of the canvas: larger or smaller - the input parameters are represent scaling using multiplication,  where the default is scale\( 1.0, 1.0\) using values for w, h that are less than 1.0 will make the canvas smaller in size.  Values greater than 1.0 will make the canvas larger: scale\( 2.0, 1.0\) will double the canvas width, with no change in height.  Using negative values will flip / mirror the canvas.
* **resetMatrix\( \)** // returns all transforms to their default values
* **pushMatrix\( \)** // temporarily stores prior transform values \(snapshot\) // isolates transforms so they don't impact code outside of a pushMatrix\( \), popMatrix\( \) pair.
* **popMatrix\( \)** // restores the last stored transforms in the matching pushMatrix\( \) pair
* **pushMatrix\( \), popMatrix\( \)** must be used in a pair, and can be nested to create relative transforms - pushMatrix stores prior transforms using a stack data-structure so that the most recently stored value can be accessed using popMatrix\( \), it returns the most recently stored values from the 'top' of the 'stack' of stored snapshots

### translate\( x-offset, y-offset\)

The processing translate function moves the canvas origin x-offset in the x direction, y-offset in the y direction.  

### Using translate with custom functions

Translation can be very useful when writing a function that draws some shapes at a location specified as input parameters.    
  
There are 3 different versions of the drawShape functions below, which provide examples of how to use transforms when writing custom functions because it allows a shape to be repositioned by using translate\( \) within the function, rather than adding the xPos, yPos variables to each shape's input arguments.   

**Using  translate\( \), resetMatrix\( \) - Problematic**   
**Important Caution:**  **drawShape2** uses translate\( \) within the function to simplify the code used to create individual shapes, however, it is **not good to use resetMatrix\( \)** to undo translate\( \) within a function....as **it will undo all transforms** that may have happened prior to the function being called..it will **cause unexpected behavior - side effects.**  
  
**Best Approach:  translate\( \), pushMatrix\( \), popMatrix\( \)**  
As shown in drawShape3\( ...\), using pairs of pushMatrix\( \), popMatrix\( \). Any transforms used between pairs of pushMatrix\( \), popMatrix\( \) will not impact code outside of that pair.  pushMatrix\( \) stores a snapshot of any prior transforms, popMatrix\( \) uses the stored shapshot to return the transformMatrix to the same state it was in prior to pushMatrix\( \).  Therefore, any transforms used within the function will not impact code outside of the function.  It is important that custom functions do not cause weird side-effects, therefore: D**o not ever use resetMatrix\( \) within a custom function.**

```javascript
//messy approach 
var drawShape1 = function( xPos, yPos ){  
    fill(255, 0,0);
    rect( 10 + xPos, 20 + yPos, 50, 80) ; //adjust shape values, messy
};

//better approach, use transform within the functions
//BIG POTENTIAL PROBLEMS - see comments about using resetMatrix( ) in a function
var drawShape2 = function( xPos, yPos ){
 translate( xPos, yPos); //move origin to xPos, yPos
 fill( 255, 0,0);
 rect( 10, 20, 50, 80 ); //draw shape relative to origin
 //IT IS BEST to UNDO all transforms used within functions  
 //NOTE: resetMatrix() will clear transforms outside of the function - NOT IDEAL
 //WARNING - don't use resetMatrix( ) inside a function - it can cause odd side-effects
 resetMatrix( );  //move origin back to default - 
   };
  
  //BEST APPROACH, use pushMatrix( ), popMatrix( ) within the function
  var drawShape3 = function( xPos, yPos ){
  pushMatrix(); //stores a snapshot of prior transforms
  translate( xPos, yPos); //move origin to xPos, yPos
  fill( 255, 0,0);
  rect( 10, 20, 50, 80 ); //draw shape relative to origin
  popMatrix( );  //reset prior transforms
  };
  
   //call the function
  drawShape1( 100, 200); 
  drawShape2( 100, 200); 
  
  //if using transform prior to calling the function
  //then version: drawShape3 will keep the prior transform undisturbed
  translate( 100, 100); //
  drawShape3( 100, 100); //displayed at 200, 200
  drawShape3( 0, 0 );  //displayed at 100,100 due to translate still in effect
  resetMatrix();
```

**Where do you think the rectangle will be drawn relative to the default origin?**

at the point:  \( 110, 220 \)
{% endhint %}

## Rotate\( someDegrees\)

The processing r**otate\( \)** function rotates the canvas around the origin as a pivot point.  This can be a bit confusing.  It is **almost always necessary to use the translate\( xDist, yDist \) function when using rotate\( \)** because most of time you do not want to rotate from the upper left corner of the canvas.  So, first you must use translate\( \) so that you can move the origin to the desired pivot position, then call rotate\( \), then draw shapes, **finally, call resetMatrix\( \)** to put the origin back to the default position.  

```javascript
//use transform, rotate functions - elegant
var drawShape3 =  function( xPos, yPos, angle ){
 translate( xPos, yPos); //move origin to xPos, yPos
 rotate( angle );  // rotation is always around the origin
 fill( 255, 0,0);
 rect( 10, 20, 50, 80 ); //draw shape relative to origin
 resetMatrix( );  //move origin back to default location
  };
  
  drawShape3( 100, 200, 75 );   //angle is 75% 
```

## Transformation Matrix

The transformation **`matrix`** is a global data-table that stores the configuration information of the canvas. 

The **default** values for the matrix can always be reset by calling the function: **`resetMatrix()`**. This resets the canvas so the origin is at the upper left corner, and resets rotation to 0 degrees and scaling to 1.0.

## resetMatrix\(\)

The resetMatrix\( \) function sets the origin back to the original, upper-left corner of the canvas, and it removes all other pushMatrix, popMatrix \(snapshot\) data from the transformation-history stack.

```java
var draw = function(){

    translate( 100, 100);
    rotate( 30 );
    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rotated rect drawn at 100,100
    resetMatrix();
    //rectangle below is not impacted by prior transforms
    //since resetMatrix reset to transforms to default 
    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rect drawn at canvas origin: 0,0

}
```

## pushMatrix\(\), popMatrix\(\)

The `pushMatrix()` function stores the current state of the transformation Matrix in a **stack** structure, it is like a snapshot is taken of the current transform values and that is saved for later use. Then the `popMatrix()` function can be used to retrieve the most recent state of the transformation matrix that was stored on the **stack.** pushMatrix and popMatrix must be used in pairs, pushMatrix is used to save the state of the transforms that have already been applied prior to pushMatrix\( \) being called. Once popMatrix\(\) is called, all changes to transforms that happened after the most recent pushMatrix\( \) are undone, but all prior transforms still impact shapes drawn after popMatrix\( \). 

To summarize, any transforms set within a pair of pushMatrix\( \) and popMatrix\( \) functions do not impact any code outside of that pair of functions. However, any transforms applied prior to pushMatrix\( \) remain. This allows for creating nested transform relationships between shapes such as a character's center point, and rotation that would occur at a character's shoulder, elbow, and wrist.

```java
var draw = function(){

    translate( 100, 0); //shift origin horizontal 
    pushMatrix();
      translate( 0, 100); //shift origin vertically
      rotate( 30 ); 
      rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rotated rect drawn at 100,100
    popMatrix(); //undoes transforms since last pushMatrix( )
    //rectangle below is impacted by original translate(100,0), but none of the changes inside pushMatrix(), popMatrix( ) pair.

    rect( 0, 0, 50, 50); //rect drawn at: 100,0
}
```

## rectMode\( CENTER\)

The processing function: rectMode\( CENTER \); changes the way that rectangles are drawn. All rectangles drawn after this line of code will have the x,y input parameters used as the rectangle's center point. This makes it easier to rotate rectangles around their center point. This can be undone using rectMode\(CORNER\);
