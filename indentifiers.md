###Identifiers 
An identifier is a user defined name that can be used for user-created variables or functions, there are specific syntax rules for identifier names:
- identifiers can only contain: letters, numbers, the underscore character `_` or the dollar `$` character.
- identifiers must start with a letter, an underscore, or dollar-sign (not with a number)
- identifiers cannot contain white-space or blank spaces
- javascript is case-sensitive: `myValue` and `Myvalue` are not equivalent
