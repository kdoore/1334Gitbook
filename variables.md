#Variables

**Variables** act as named containers where the programmer can store values that will be changing in their programs.

The keyword ```var``` is used to tell the computer that the next word in the program will be a user-defined *identifier*  This *varible-name* acts as a label to identify an area in the computer's main memory where the programmer can store and modify values to make the program more flexible. 

**Declare and initialize a variable:**

```
var mySpecialValue;  //declare a variable
    mySpecialValue=5;  //assign an integer literal to the variable
    mySpecialValue = 15 * 2; //assign a new value to the variable
    ```

The code above creates a variable by declaring the keyword: var, followed by the identifier name  ``mySpecialValue``. In the next statement, we assigns the value 5 to the variable. The third line of code changes the value stored in the memory location: ``mySpecialValue``  to the result of the evaluation of the expression: 15 * 2.  

###Variable Types

Javascript in a **loosely-typed** programming language. This is in contrast to most other programming languages which are **strongly-typed**.  In **strongly-typed** languages, when we want to declare a variable, we must first specify the **data-type** that we want to use.  When we write programs, we
