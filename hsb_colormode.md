#HSB Color Mode

The Processing HSB colormode provides a powerful option for using color as design features in our programs.  When working with RGB colors, it can be difficult to determine how to modify an RGB value using code, for example how can we modify an RGB value to get a slightly darker shade of the current fill color?  However, The HSB colormode allows programmatic control over the Hue, Saturation, and Brightness of colors. For example, a user-interaction can be used to trigger a decrease in Brightness, as an easy way add hover-type behaviors to button shapes. 

###HSB Colors
The image below shows the HSB colorspace.  From this diagram, we can see that if we want to understand a specific HSB color, given in terms of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness parameter values, it is easiest to read a HSB color starting with the brightness parameter.  
###Brightness
The brightness scale defines grayscale colors, where a brightness value of 0 corresponds to black, and the max- brightness corresponds to white.  So, if we see an HSB value with O for brightness, the other values don't impact the color because the colorspace is at the lowest tip of the cone, black is the only color in this region.  So for a fill() function with 3 values fill(H, S, B), we should start reading the color from the right-most parameter, the B value.  If the B value is 255 (the max value), then we can see that these colors correspond to the top surface-edge of the cone.  
###Saturation
Within this circular slice, we can see that the center of the circle is white, and as the radius increases, the saturation increases so the outer rim of the circle has full saturation values.  So, when analyzing an HSB value, once we've determined that B is greater than 0, we next need to look at the S value to determine the saturation level.  This corresponds to moving outwards from the centerpoint of the circle, to colors with higher saturation intensity.  
###Hue
The hue value corresponds to the angle of rotation around the circle.  This image shows the hue angle incorrectly, for processing the hue values increase in the clockwise direction, with the 0 value at the 3 o'clock position.

###Color Wheel
To create a simple color-wheel, we can use the arc() function, in conjunction with the HSB colorMode().

The *Processing.js* ``arc()`` function takes 6 parameters: x, y, w, h, startDegree, endDegree.  In the Khan Academy, all angles use degree measurement as the default, while for other *Processing.org* programs, radians is the default angular measurement mode. So, in the jsbin code example, all angle measurements are wrapped in the ``radians( )`` function to convert our angle degree value into the equivalent radians value.


```java
//Let's make a color wheel by mapping HSB values to arc() //segments that are positioned radially around the center.
//HSB colors represent a color wheel with 0 degrees=red, 120 //degrees=green, 240 degrees=blue
//we need to match the arc startDegree to the correct HSB 
//hue value, where the HSB hue values range from 0 to 255
//For example: we want green color at 120 degrees 
//with a hue value of 120/360 => (1/3)*255
//we'll create variables to represent these values

//setup
colorMode(HSB);
background(0, 0, 255);
noStroke();

//declare and initialize variables
var hueValue=0;  //the current color of the hueValue, will modified to map to the current HSB.
var startDegree=0;  //the arc parameter that starts the arc, will be modified to draw new arcs
var angleSlice=60; //the degree 'width' of each arc.  How much each arc is offset from the previous arc
var endDegree=angleSlice; //the endpoint for an arc, the offset of size 'angleSlice', from the arc startDegree.
translate(200,200);  //move the origin to the center of the canvas


//using initialized values  Create first arc which is red
fill(hueValue, 255, 255);
//arc(x,y,w,h,start,stop)
arc(0,0,300,300,startDegree,endDegree); //first arc
//begin incrementing startDegree, endDegree, and hueValue


while( startDegree <360 ){
 
    startDegree=startDegree+angleSlice;  //termination, we know that startDegree keeps incrementing and will eventually be larger than 360
    endDegree=endDegree+angleSlice;
    hueValue=(startDegree / 360) * 255;
    // keep changing hue value, use that to color each arc
    fill(hueValue, 255, 255);
    //arc(x,y,w,h,start,stop)
    arc(0,0,300,300,startDegree,endDegree); //first arc
    
} // end while-loop

```
