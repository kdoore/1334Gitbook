###Finite State Machine

Finite State Machine (FSM) is abstraction to simplify reasoning about complex, event driven systems.

To represent a system as a finite state machine, it is necessary to identify all possible states for the system, and to identify all possible events that can change the state of the system.

Once a system has been defined using FSM notation, it becomes easier to design the program logic for implementing the animation.
