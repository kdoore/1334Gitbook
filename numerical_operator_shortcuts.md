# Numerical Operator Shortcuts

Some Numerical Operations are so common that many languages provide shortcut syntax.  

When modifying the value of a variable based on the current value of the variable, the syntax for addition would be:

``` javascript
var x = 10;

x = x + 3;  // increment x by 3

x = x - 4;  // decrease x by 4

x = x * 2 // multiply x by 2

x = x / 5 //divide x by 5

///The shortcut syntax for the above

x += 3; 

x -= 4;

x *= 2;

x /= 5;

```
