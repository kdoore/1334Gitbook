###Loops with Mathematical Formulas for Position

Often we need to repeat execution for some some block of code.  There are 2 basic control structures that can be used for repeating blocks of code, these are both considered as _**loop**_ control structures because we can think of repetition as a looping procedure.  

###For-loops  - Count Controlled Loops
When we have code we want repeated,
