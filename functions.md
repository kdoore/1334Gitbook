#Functions
Functions allow us to create modular sections of code to add structure and organization to our code.  We can name these chunks of code, which makes it easy to **call** the functions so they can execute in the desired order.  We have been using, or ``calling` functions that are part of the Processing Library.  But now we'll learn how to write our own custom functions.  Therefore we need to understand function syntax for javascript.
