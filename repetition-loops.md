#Repetition - Loops

When we have some set of logic that needs to be executed multiple times, then we can use a loop control structure to have a chunk of code repeated.  There are 2 main types of loop control structure:
    1. `while` loop - execute repetition as for as long as a test condition remains true
    
    2. `for` loop   - execute repetition for a specific number of times
