###Algorithm - specific steps to solve a problem
  Pseudo-code and Flow-charts are code-agnostic ways to specify an algorithm to represent a process or to solve a problem

### Process or System Models

 - Identify components in a system.
 - Create a representation of that system using programming.(simulation)
 - Metaphors are useful in creating representations. (Desktop metaphor)
