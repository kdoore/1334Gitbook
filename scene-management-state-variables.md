###Scene Management - State Variables

In the Khan Academy code examples, they provide an example of how to design logic for showing game-type scenes.  The logic is the same as the Finite State Machine logic that we've used for our character.  

###Finite State Machine for Scene Management
Finite State Machine structure can be used to design a system if we have a finite number of states, such that we can list them in a table or diagram.  In addition, we have a finite set of events that can cause the system to change state.  Finally, an FSM must have a memory-variable that keeps track of the current state of the system.
