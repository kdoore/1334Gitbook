## Computer Programming: Javascript and Processing

1. A sequence of instructions for a computer system to execute

2. Programming Languages like _**Javascript**_ define ‘syntax’ of how to write instructions

3. Programming Libraries like _**Processing.js**_ provide pre-written functions for common tasks

4. A Script or Program is a series of instructions translated into a strict, formal language - simple enough for a computer to interpret or execute.

5. Computers store data, and can execute statements in a program.   

6. Data is stored in a computer's memory in the form of digital bits with a value of: 1 or 0 

   1. a byte is a chunk-size of memory that consists of 8 digital bits of memory.   

   2. a byte can hold 256 possible values \(0 - 255\)

### Algorithm - specific steps to solve a problem

Pseudo-code and Flow-charts are code-agnostic ways to specify an algorithm to represent a process or to solve a problem

### Program Instructions

* **Statements** - Like a sentence \(a command\)
* **Expressions** - evaluate to a single value
* **Functions** - a way to structure code to make it modular and to support code reuse

### Program Design and Modeling

* A representation of structure or process.
* Identify components in a system.
* Create a representation of that system using programming.\(simulation\)
* Metaphors are useful in creating representations. \(Desktop metaphor\)
* Mental Model: our internal representation of a system
