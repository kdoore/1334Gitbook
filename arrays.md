###Arrays are Objects
Arrays are objects in javascript, this means that arrays have properties and functions that the array object can use.  

###Initialization of Arrays , Bracket Notation
There are several methods to initialize arrays, one method creates an empty array, where empty square brackets indicate an Array type variable is created.  The second method to declare and initailize an array is to put values within the square brackets when declaring the variable.  
Bracket notation is used when working with arrays.  

    var myElements = [ ];  //declare an empty array
    
    var myElements2 = [ 1, 2, 5 ]; // an array with 3 elements




Declare an array

###Length Property
    Array's have a `length` property, which stores the number of elements in the array.  This is determined by the position of the last item in the array.  An array can have a large length, yet not have valid data in each array element.
