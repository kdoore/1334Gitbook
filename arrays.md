#Arrays

Arrays are a data-structure that can be used store multiple variable values. Arrays provide methods to store and retrieve values from an ordered list, items are arranged in the list based on the order they are added to the list.We access an element of the list using the ‘index’  or position value of the item, where array indexes start at 0 and end with the index value: length-1.Arrays in javascript are `objects`, where objects have behaviors and properties that can be accessed by the actual object instance.
